	description = The S200 ATV Aft Thruster Cluster was developed for attitude control, orbital manoeuvring and braking of ESA's Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV). The thruster clusters deliver both steady state thrust and impulse bit and can also be used as back-up in the event of main engine failure.
