	@title = CHT-400 Monopropellant Thruster (400N)
	@manufacturer = Airbus Defence & Space 
	@description = The CHT-400 thruster is primarily used for the attitude and roll control of the Ariane 5 launch vehicle during its ascent. The thruster can also be used for re-entry attitude control applications as successfully demonstrated during ARD mission. CHT-400 thrusters are also the decent engines for the ExoMars Schiaparelli Lander, nine of the thrusters fire to control the lander in the final decent to the martian surface.
